Metalearning in the Metaverse ([M]2) is a social event in virtual reality at [ICML 2020](https://icml.cc/virtual/2020). There will be a cafe, where people can drink and chat in a relaxed environment, as well as a presentation area where people can discuss work (feel free to tell us a priori if you want to present something).

We will use NeosVR which can be downloaded free on Steam. It also has a desktop client if you don't have VR.
