Metalearning in the Metaverse ([M]2) is a social event in virtual reality. There will be a cafe, where people can drink and chat in a relaxed environment, as well as a presentation area where people can discuss their work (feel free to tell us a priori if you want to present something).

We will use NeosVR which can be downloaded free on Steam [https://store.steampowered.com/app/740250/Neos_VR/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/740250/Neos_VR/). It also has a desktop client, in case you don't have VR.

### How to join

1. Download NeosVR on Steam [https://store.steampowered.com/app/740250/Neos_VR/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/740250/Neos_VR/)

The session will be called `ICML2020 - M2`, and will be public, so you can also find in the Neos Session browser.
