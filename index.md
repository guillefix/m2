Metalearning in the Metaverse (M2) is a social event in virtual reality. There will be a cafe, where people can drink and chat in a relaxed environment, as well as a presentation area where people can discuss their work (feel free to tell us a priori if you want to present something).

We will use NeosVR which can downloaded for free on Steam [https://store.steampowered.com/app/740250/Neos_VR/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/740250/Neos_VR/). It also has a desktop client, in case you don't have VR.

### How to join

1. Download NeosVR from Steam [https://store.steampowered.com/app/740250/Neos_VR/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/740250/Neos_VR/)
2. Join the session by clicking this link: `link comming soon`.

If this doesn't work, please contact us at guillefix@gmail.com or ding.shin.huang@oxai.org
The session will be called `ICML2020 - M2`, and will be public, so you may also find in the Neos session browser if you want.
